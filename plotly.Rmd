My name is Alison and I make websites _with interactive graphics!!_

```{r}
set.seed(1)

data(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, 
    price, room_type, lat, long) %>% 
  filter(
    !is.na(rating),
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
    ) %>% 
  sample_n(5000)
```

# Making Interactive Plots

Here's a scatterplot
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, 
                            '\nRating: ', rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```
